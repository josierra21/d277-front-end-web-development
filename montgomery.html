            <h2 class="section-title">History</h2>
            <h3>Founding and Early Years</h3>
            <p>Montgomery began as two separate riverfront settlements: Alabama Town and New Philadelphia. They 
                were founded by General John Scott and Andrew Dexter, respectively. Amid competition for settlers,
                the adjacent towns merged on December 3, 1819, to officially become Montgomery, named in honor of
                Revolutionary War hero Major General Richard Montgomery. This happened just eleven days before 
                Alabama was admitted to the Union.
            </p>
            <p>Within a few years, Montgomery became a vital hub for the region's booming cotton trade, leveraging
                steamboat access via the Alabama River. The city was designated as the county seat in 1822, and the
                first courthouse was constructed in the city's Court Square, which also was a spot to one of
                the largest slave markets in the South. 
            </p>
            <h3>Civil War Era</h3>
            <p>In 1861, Montgomery briefly served as the first capital of the Confederacy, with the Alabama
                State Capitol hosting Jefferson Davis's inauguration. Later that year, the capital was moved to 
                Richmond, Virginia, but Montgomery remained an important Confederate city
            </p>
            <h3>Civil Rights Movement</h3>
            <p>Montgomery played a central role in the mid-20th century Civil Rights Movement. In 1955,
                Rosa Parks's refusal to give up her bus seat sparked the Montgomery Bus Boycott, a year-
                long protest led in part by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. that ended segregation on city 
                buses. The city was also a key site in the Freedom Riders campaign of 1961 and the Selma-
                to-Montgomery marches of 1965, which culminated at the State Capitol and helped lead to the 
                Voting Rights Act.
