            <h2 class="section-title">About Mobile</h2>
            <p>Located in Alabama's Gulf Coast at the head of Mobile Bay, Mobile is the state's
                oldest city and a key cultural and economic hub. Founded in 1702 as the first 
                capital of French colonial Louisiana, it reflects centuries of French, Spanish,
                British, Creole, and African Influences. Situated in the southwestern region of
                Alabama, Mobile is classified as an urban city, offering a mix of historic charm
                with modern industry, shipping, and education. Known as the "Azalea City" and the 
                birthplace of Mardi Gras in the U.S., it remains both a cultural landmark and a 
                thriving center of commerce.
            </p>
            <h3>Demographics &#38; Statistics</h3>

            <h2 class="section-title">History</h2>
            <h3>Colonial Beginnings</h3>
            <p>Mobile was founded in 1702 by the French and served as the first capital of French Louisiana.
                It later passed into British hands in 1763, then Spanish in 1780, before finally becoming 
                part of the United States in 1813.
            </p>
            <h3>19th Century Growth</h3>
            <p>During the 1800s, Mobile thrived as a cotton port city, enriched by shipping, river trade, and 
                international commerce. Its Mardi Gras tradition began in 1830, predating New Orleans' celebrations.
                The city also saw antebellum prosperity reflected in its surviving mansions and churches.
            </p>
            <h3>Civil War &#38; Reconstruction</h3>
            <p>Mobile was a major confederate port during the Civil War, famously tied to the 
                Battle of Mobile Bay in 1864 where Admiral David Farragut declared, "Damn the torpedoes,
                full of speed ahead!" Following the Union victory, Mobile entered the Reconstruction era,
                gradually rebuilding its economy and infrastructure while transitioning from a wartime 
                stronghold to a renewed center of trade and industry.
            </p>
            <h2 class="section-title">Modern Mobile</h2>
            <p>Today, Mobile is a city that balances its maritime and industrial heritage with modern
                growth in sectors such as medicine, aerospace, shipping, and higher education. The Port
                of Mobile remains one of the busiest in the nation, while the University of South Alabama
                and local medical centers anchor the city's health and research presence.
            </p>
            <p>Mobile has also drawn renewed national and international attention through the story
                of Clotilda, the last known slave ship to arrive in the United States. Smuggled into 
                Mobile Bay in 1860 &#40;more than 50 years after the transatlantic slave trade was 
                outlawed&#41; the Clotilda brought 110 captive West Africans to Alabama. After emancipation,
                many of the survivors created a community in their own just north of the city, known as
                Africatown. There they preserved elements of their language, culture, and traditions, building
                churches, schools, and businesses in what became a rare, self-sustaining settlement of formerly
                enslaved Africans.
            </p>
            <p>In 2019, archaeologists confirmed the discovery of the Clotilda wreck in the Mobile River,
                which further underscored Africatown's historic importance. The opening of the Africatown
                Heritage House in 2023 has provided a museum and cultural center dedicated to telling the 
                story of the Clotilda and its descendants, making Africatown both a living community and
                a vital part of Mobile's identity. Today, as Mobile continues to modernize its economy and
                waterfront, it also embraces this layered history, honoring its role in the nation's 
                industrial development while preserving the resilience and legacy of communities like Africatown.
