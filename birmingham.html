            <h2 class="section-title">History</h2> 
            <h3>Founding and Early Years</h3>
            <p>Birmingham is the youngest of Alabama's major cities, founded in 1871 at the crossing of 
                two rail lines in normth-central Alabama, near some of the richest deposits of iron ore,
                coal, and limestone in the world. The city was named after Birmingham, England, a center
                of iron and steel production. Its rapid industrial growth earned it the nickname "Magic City"
                , later also called the "Pittsburgh of the South.
            </p>
            <p>The city's creation was spearheaded by the Elyton Land Company, with James R. Powell,
                nicknamed the "Duke of Birmingham", as its promoter and first elected mayor. Despite
                early setbacks from a cholera epidemic in 1873 and the national economic panic that 
                same year, Birmingham survived thanks to its mineral wealth, which soon fueled an 
                industrial boom.
            </p>
            <h3>Depression and Recovery</h3>
            <p>Like much of the nation, Birmingham was devastated by the Great Depression. In 1930,
                the Hoover administration called it "the hardest hit city in the nation." Thousands
                were unemployed as mills closed. The outbreak of WWII revived the city, as its steel 
                mills became crucial to the war effort. After the war, Birmingham diversified into
                new industries such as chemicals, farm equipment, cement, and eventually aviation with
                Hayes Aircraft
            </p>
            <h3>Civil Rights Era</h3>
            <p>Birmingham also became a focal point of the Civil Rights Movement. Known grimly as
                "Bombingham" for the many racially motivated bombings of homes and churches, the city
                gianed national attention in the 1960s
            </p>
            <p>In 1963, activists led by Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth and the Southern Christian Leadership
                Conference invited Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to join the Birmingham Campaign, protesting
                segregation in downtown businesses. King was jailed and penned his famous "Letter
                from Birmingham Jail." The nation was horrified by images of Police Commissioner "Bull"
                Connor unleashing fire hoses and police dogs on young demonstrators. Later that year, 
                the 16th Street Babtist Church bombing killed four young girls, an act that galvanized
                support for the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

            </p>
            <h3>Modern Birmingham</h3>
            <p>In the decades that followed, Birmingham rebuilt its reputation. The city elected its 
                first Black mayor, Richard Arrington Jr., in 1979. The University of Alabama grew into 
                a world-class medical research center, and Birmingham became one of the nation's largest
                banking hubs. Today, the Birmingham-Hoover metro area is Alabama's largest metropolitan
                region, with a diversified economy spanning medicine, finance, technology, construction,
                and education, while preserving its historical role as a center of industry and civil rights.
