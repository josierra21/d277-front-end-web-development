                <h2 class="section-title">Discover Alabama</h2>
                <p>Alabama is a state rich in history, culture, and natural beauty. From the rolling hills of
                    Birmingham to the coastal charm of Mobile, there's something here for every visitor. 
                    The state was declared a part of the United States in 1819 and shares its borders with
                    Tennessee to the north, Georgia to the east, Mississippi to the west, and Florida and
                    the Gulf of Mexico to the south. Montgomery is the state capital and holds a significant
                    place in American history as the birthplace of the civil rights movement, where pivotal
                    moments such as the Montgomery Bus Boycott began. Whether you're interested in exploring 
                    the scenic nature trails, discovering historical landmarks, enjoying vibrant music and 
                    food festivals, Alabama offers a diverse blend of attractions and experiences that reflect
                    the heart of the American South.

                <h2 class="section-title">Land</h2>
                <p>Alabama stretches from the Appalachian Mountains in the north to the Gulf of Mexico in the south,
                    offering a mix of rolling hills, flat plains, forests, and sandy beaches. The state is home to
                    many rivers, including the Alabama and Tennessee Rivers, which support its fertile soil and vegetation. 
                    With scenic valleys, pine-covered highlands, and a warm coastline, Alabama's geography supports a wide 
                    variety of wildlife and outdoor activities. This diverse terrain makes the state both a beautiful
                    place to explore and an important region for agriculture and industry. 
                </p>
                <h2 class="section-title">Wildlife and National Parks</h2>
                <p>Alabama is home to a wide range of wildlife thanks to its forests, wetlands, and coastal areas.
                    Visitors might spot white-tailed deer, black bears, wild turkeys, or even alligators in the 
                    southern regions. The state is also known for its birdwatching, with hundreds of bird species
                    passing through each year, including bald eagles, great blue herons, red-tailed hawks, and 
                    northern cardinals. Alabama offers several national and state parks where people can enjoy nature,
                    including Little River Canyon National Preserve, known for its scenic waterfalls, and the 
                    Talladega National Forest, which offers miles of hiking trails. Gulf State Park along the coast
                    features beaches, trails, and opportunities to spot coastal wildlife such as bottlenose dolphins, 
                    sea turtles, pelicans, and crabs thriving in the warm coastal waters. 
                </p>
                <h2 class="section-title">Culture</h2>
                <p>Rich Southern heritage, tradition, and community values define the culture of the state.
                    From historic civil rights landmarks to small-town festivals, the state celebrates its
                    past while embracing its diversity. Storytelling, quilting, and gospel music remain central
                    to community life, passed down through generations. Alabama also helped shape American music
                    by giving rise to ragtime, jazz, country, and blues. The Muscle Shoals recording studios
                    played a key role in defining soul music with artists like Aretha Franklin and the Rolling 
                    Stones. Cultural celebrations are part of everyday life, including Mobile's Mardi Gras, 
                    the oldest in the nation, rooted in French and Creole traditions.
