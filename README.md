# Alabama City Guide Website

## Project Overview
This project is a multi page informational website created as part of a front end web development course. The goal of the assignment was to design and build a website for one U.S. state that highlights multiple cities within that state using only core web technologies.

The website focuses on the state of Alabama and provides individual pages for three major cities. Each city page presents information about history, demographics, cost of living, attractions, culture, and education. The site also includes a contact form and consistent navigation across all pages.
